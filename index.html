                    <li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>2 cups (480ml) heavy cream</li>
                    <li>2 cups (200g) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>
                    <h3>Cook the Pasta</h3>
                    <p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt generously (the water should taste like the sea). Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente, usually 8-10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Start the Sauce</h3>
                    <p>While the pasta is cooking, melt the butter in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. If using garlic, add it to the melted butter and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant (be careful not to brown the garlic).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Add Cream</h3>
                    <p>Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 2 minutes to slightly thicken the sauce.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Add Cheese</h3>
                    <p>Remove the skillet from heat and gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with black pepper, a pinch of nutmeg (if using), and salt to taste.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Combine with Pasta</h3>
                    <p>Add the drained fettuccine to the sauce and toss gently to coat. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Serve</h3>
                    <p>Serve immediately in warm bowls. Garnish with additional grated Parmesan and chopped fresh parsley if desired.</p>
                </li>

                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Use Fresh Ingredients</h3>
                    <p>The quality of your ingredients significantly impacts the final dish. Use freshly grated Parmesan cheese rather than pre-grated options, as it melts better and has superior flavor.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Pasta Timing</h3>
                    <p>Cook the pasta until it's just al dente, as it will continue to cook slightly when tossed with the hot sauce.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Serve Immediately</h3>
                    <p>Fettuccine Alfredo is best enjoyed immediately after preparation, as the sauce can thicken and the pasta may absorb too much liquid if left to sit.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Variations</h3>
                    <p>For added protein, consider adding grilled chicken, sautéed shrimp, or steamed broccoli to your Fettuccine Alfredo.</p>
